# discord-always-online

Updated with additional functionality from SealedSaucer's Always Online script.
- Supports multi-threading websocket handling, so you can run as many tokens as you want. (Keep in mind of high resource usage, not very scalable)
- Create a `tokens.txt` file in the same directory with the following format: `bTjas...AjsnDE // username#0001`
